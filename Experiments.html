                            <p><b>Compute Shader rendering half a million of Cubes</b><br><br>A small exercice about moving repetitive calculations on the GPU.<br><br>The goal was to have a first experience with compute buffers, rendering and HLSL.<br><br>Above, the CPU is using a GameObject, and struggling with 50*50 cubes resolution.<br><br>On the right, GPU only uses positions and mesh datas to draw and move cubes on multiple threads. Half a million of cubes are easily rendered.</p>

                            <p><b>Boss Fight in Unreal Engine</b><br><br>My goal was to practice AI and learn about <b>state machines</b> and behavior trees.<br>In this project, the Bear is <b>a Boss, chasing and attacking player</b> with both range and melee attack.<br><br>His behavior is based on Unreal Blackboard and Behavior Tree.<br><br><b>Transitions</b> between states are <b>triggered by conditions</b>. When fullfiled, the bear switch state. Those conditions are easier to fullfill when the Boss his low on health, as a <b>fury mode</b>.</p>

                            <p><b>RayTracing In One WeekEnd</b><br><br>The technical demo on Unreal Engine 5 made me curious about rendering. <br><br>The book "RayTracing In One WeekEnd" by Peter Shirley is a great and quick <b>introduction to RayTracing</b>, and also made me practice C++.</p>
