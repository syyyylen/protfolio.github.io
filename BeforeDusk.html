                            <p>Last year school project, 8 months of production.<br>A <b>Voodoo doll</b> explores a jungle using her power to <b>transfer everything harmful that happens to her</b>. <br>Strong needs in code architecture, optimization and programming physics.</p>

                            <p>In <b>Before Dusk</b>, this charming <b>Voodoo Doll</b> escapes slavery and crosses a jungle, seeking for the <b>sorceress that imprisoned her soul</b>.<br><br>The player embodies this revolted doll, which has the ability to <b>create a Voodoo link with objects or living things</b>.<br><br>When she is linked to something, <b>everything bad</b> or harmful that happens to her will equally be <b>transfered </b>to the linked entity.</p>

                            <p>One of the main challenges in terms of code on this project was the <b>sandbox</b> aspect of the in game interactions.<br><br>In the game, the player can <b>catch fire</b>, <b>be thrown</b> away by an <b>explosion</b>, hit walls severely... And all <b>those things must happen simultaneously</b> to the linked object or opponent.<br><br>We based our architecture on an <b>Interface</b>, IEffectable, which <b>guarantees that the object can take effects</b>.<br>Effects can be triggered under <b>conditions or transfered</b> by the player, which is also an IEffectable.</p>

                            <p>To help the Level Design, avoid weird behaviors and game breaking interactions we needed a <b>custom Editor</b> for IEffectables objects.<br><br>In the editor, we <b>simulate behaviors to anticipate</b> what will happen in game (fire propagation, explosion on the right).</p>

                            <p><br>Physics interactions aren't handled by Unity's physics engine.<br>We <b>take control over displacements</b> to have <b>predictible movements which fit our metrics </b>.<br><br>On the right, we use a <b>kinematic equation</b> to calculate the starting velocity that spring will apply to an object in order to <b>follow a determined path</b>.
