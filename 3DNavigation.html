                            <p>The idea of this project was born during a Game Jam where the player was fighting <b>flying enemies</b>, and their pathfinding wasn't as fluent as I wanted it to be.<br><br>After reading a few things about navigation, <b>I've thought that the octree datastructure was an efficient way to retrace scene geometry</b>.<br><br>Subdividing occupied nodes is <b>adding complexity only where it's required</b> to have a precise representation of obstacles.</p>

                            <p>The <b>OctreeNode</b> class is a simple C# class, containing data like position or depth, and a few methods like the recursive Split.<br><br>The <b>Navigation Volume</b>  manages the Root Node, the visual representation and the navmesh actualization.<br><br><b>Tolerance</b> is the purcentage of the node that must be occupied to subdivide.</p>

                        <div id="Grid">
                            <p>The next step was to find an alogrithm to <b>find neighbors Nodes</b>.<br><br>I first tried a <b>system of adresses</b>, with each nodes having a <b>binary adress</b>.<br><br>But I was stuck, so I've decided to <b>change my paradigm</b> and to use geometry and <b>positions calculations</b> to find the closest nodes.<br><br>With this new approach, I was quickly able to find neighbors Nodes and to have <b>this new Graph</b>, called a <b>Dual</b>.<br><br>I'm not yet satisfied by the <b>cost of the algorithm</b> which remains high, so I'll keep optimizing it in the future.</p>

                                <p>On the left, you can see <b>every leaf Node relied to her neighbors</b>.<br><br>Those neighbors doesn't need to be found at initialization, but I've kept a debug mode were the dual is build because it looks really pretty to me. And for debugging. Of course.<br><br>The next step was to <b>implement A*</b>.

                            <p>I've implemented the basic version of A*, and now <b>the Agent is able to move to his destination</b>.<br><br>The path can be quickly <b>recalculated at runtime</b> if the destination of the agent changes.<br><br>The path is still <b>suboptimal</b>, and my next goal is to <b>add curves</b> to the motion make the movement more fluid.</p>
